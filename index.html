		<h2>About Me</h2><hr>
		<img src="./assets/images/apeksha.jpeg" id="bio-image" alt="apeksha">
		<p>Hello!! My name is Apeksha Hakim and I am currently studying full-stack web development at The Coding Boot Camp at UNC Charlotte. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have worked as an Application Support Analyst for 4 years where I focused on delivering support to the existing business users and resolving application errors. While working as a Support Engineer I discovered that I was more interested in designing and developing dynamic web applications</p>
                    <p>I like things that challenge me intellectually and have an eye for detail and a passion for perfection. My focus of work is currently HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I am looking forward to learning the latest technologies in the industry to create interactive websites using best practices and web standard guidelines.</p>
                    <p>I have a wide variety of interests and dabble in them from time to time.I am always looking to try something new and different. Few of my interests include baking, traveling (love beaches), tennis, trying out different sport activities from time to time, listening to music and the list goes on. </p>
